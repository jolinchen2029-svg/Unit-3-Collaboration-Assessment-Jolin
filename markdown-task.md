### Tree Identification Tool
You can use this simple **Javascript** function to identify a tree by its characteristics:

```
function identity_tree {leaf_shape, region}{
 if {leaf_shape ■■ "needle" && region ■■ "cold"}{
    return "Pine Tree"
    } else if {leaf_shape ■■ "broad" && region ■■ "temperate"}{
    return "Oak Tree"
    } else {
    return "Unknown Tree"
    }

}
console.log{identify_tree("needle", "cold")}
```
